# Computer Vision Laboratories
Welcome to the Computer Vision laboratories GitHub repository. Here you will find all the information and the material needed for the laboratories lectures that will come.
The repository will be updated periodically with the material for the current lab. 

## Requirements
The laboratory exercises will all be written in Python (v3.6 or higher, with VisualStudioCode as IDE) and the following packages will be required:
- OpenCV with contrib
- Numpy (should be already installed as OpenCV dependency)
- Open3D for the PointCloud/Mesh section

In order to install a Python package, you need to use the `pip` package manager (`pip3` if you are using the `python3` command) with this command: `pip install *package_name*`. The names of the required packages are:
- `opencv-python`
- `opencv-contrib-python`
- `numpy`
- `open3d`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`
- `ipykernel`

## Material

The required material for the laboratories is contained in the `material` folder on the root of this repository.

> **NOTE1:** For those of you who are not familiar with GitHub, be careful when performing the `pull` action from the repository! Before  doing it, move the code you wrote to another folder or you will lose its content. The `pull` action will overwrite everything there is inside it.
